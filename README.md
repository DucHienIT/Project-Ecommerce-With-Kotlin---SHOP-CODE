# Project Ecommerce With Kotlin - SHOP-CODE

This is an Ecommerce project developed using Kotlin programming language with the MVVM architectural pattern. The project also includes API integration using Django framework.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an Ecommerce application that allows users to browse and purchase products online. The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, which separates the presentation logic from the business logic and data handling.

## Features
1. User Registration and Login: Users can create new accounts and log in to the application.
2. Product Listing: Users can view a list of products available for purchase.
3. Product Details: Users can view detailed information about a specific product.
4. Cart Management: Users can add products to their shopping cart, update the quantity, and remove items.
5. Checkout: Users can proceed to checkout and complete the purchase of selected items.
6. Order History: Users can view their order history and track the status of their orders.
7. Chat With Chatbot: 

## Technology Stack
- Kotlin: The primary programming language used for developing the Android application.
- MVVM Architecture: The architectural pattern used to separate the concerns of the application.
- Django: A powerful Python web framework used for developing the API backend.
- Django Rest Framework: An extension of Django for building RESTful APIs.
- SQLite: The default database used for storing application data.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
2. Set up the Django backend according to the instructions provided in the backend repository.
3. Open the Kotlin project in Android Studio.
4. Build and run the application on an Android emulator or physical device.

## API Integration
The project integrates Django as the backend framework for API development. The Django Rest Framework is used to create RESTful APIs that handle data retrieval and manipulation for the Ecommerce application. The Kotlin application communicates with the API endpoints to retrieve product information, manage user authentication, and process orders.
